                        this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</li>

                            field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should
                            be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all theri games away.</p>
